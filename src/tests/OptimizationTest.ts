 * Optimization Tests for FitFlow App
 *

 * that would be implemented in a real Android/iOS project.

 * in an actual Android project or Swift code in an iOS project.

  /**
   * Techniques implemented in the app for optimization:
   * 
   * 1. Lazy Loading
   *    - Images are loaded as needed (via network or from cache)
   *    - Recipe details are fetched only when a recipe is opened
   * 
   * 2. Caching
   *    - Images are cached using Supabase Storage
   *    - API responses are cached using React Query
   * 
   * 3. Memory Management
   *    - Components unmount properly to free resources
   *    - Large lists use virtual rendering
   * 
   * 4. Network Optimization
   *    - API calls are batched where possible
   *    - Redundant API calls are avoided
   * 
   * 5. UI Performance
   *    - Animations use hardware acceleration
   *    - Render optimizations like useMemo and memo

  /**
   * Example of battery usage optimization technique
   * 
   * In the app, the following battery optimizations should be implemented:
   * 
   * 1. Reduce sensor polling frequency when app is in background
   * 2. Batch network requests to minimize radio usage
   * 3. Use efficient algorithms for sensor data processing
   * 4. Implement doze mode compatibility
   * 
   * Testing can be done using Android Battery Historian or similar tools.

  /**
   * UI optimization guidelines implemented:
   * 
   * 1. Avoided overdraw by:
   *    - Using transparent backgrounds only when needed
   *    - Setting proper layer types for views
   * 
   * 2. Reduced UI complexity by:
   *    - Keeping view hierarchy shallow
   *    - Using ConstraintLayout to avoid nested layouts
   * 
   * 3. Network optimizations:
   *    - Compressed images before network transfer
   *    - Used Supabase CDN for faster image loading
   * 
   * 4. Animation optimizations:
   *    - Used hardware acceleration for complex animations
   *    - Reduced unnecessary animations during scrolling

/**
 * How to run these optimization tests:
 * 
 * 1. In Android:
 *    - Use Android Studio's Profiler for CPU, memory, and network monitoring
 *    - Use Android Vitals on Google Play for real-world performance data
 * 
 * 2. In iOS:
 *    - Use Xcode Instruments for detailed performance analysis
 *    - Use MetricKit for gathering real-world performance data
 * 
 * 3. Cross-platform:
 *    - Use Firebase Performance Monitoring for consolidated reports
